# ADBManager (AwlsomeAlex's Android ADB Device Manager)
This nifty little program is to be used as an easy way to manage your device via ADB Connections. 

## WARNING!
Loading the .bat for Windows **WILL NOT WORK** as additional steps are taken to add certain functionality to make the program work. But the source code **IS THE SAME!**

## About the Program:
I started to work on this due to complete boredom and because I have a super old tablet that can only handle the bare minimum of Android, not even Google Play. So I wanted a way to "Easily" sideload APKs. But I wanted to do more and have more functionality so I created this.

## Features:
* Easily Test for ADB Connections
* Sideload APKs to Device
* Inject files into SDCARD (Storage)
* Reboot the device normally or into recovery
* Install ADB Universal Drivers

## Programs Used:
### WINDOWS VERSION
* F2K0 BAT to EXE Converter (For easily configurable executables)
* ADB Shell's ADB Kit (Built into Executable)
* GNU Make [Windows Executable] (Built into Executable)
* ClockworkMod's Universal ADB Drivers (Installed via wget)

## How to Build:
Source Code is available, however compiling process is hard to replicate so good luck until I have time to make this. But everything needed (Except BAT to EXE Converter) is found in this repository until I get threatened to take down the executables).
